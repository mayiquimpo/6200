It's nothing but a wanna-be gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are unsympathetic to the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you are looking for something else to do, because the movie is that boring, since you already know what's going to happen. The other half of the time you're desperately hoping the protagonist grows a pair of balls or just ends his life by jumping off a bridge or something. Also, the secondary characters are for the most part one- dimensional. There's no depth to any of the characters in this movie! No depth!\n",

There are 3 or 4 laughs in it but I used the fast forward button through some of it. Don't waste your time. I only saw it because I wanted to see all of his movies, but it sucked.\n",
      "32449    Perhaps not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't help but love it to death. A five-year old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet, but it really is a magical being, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy names her, is taken back to the sea by her father, who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human, but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and cute. Where the film really comes alive, though, is in its tremendous artwork. The drawings are more child-like than in any of Miyazaki's other works, but there's beauty in its simplicity. As with all of his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was just so in awe of. Seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago (the score here is equally as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.\n",

I thought this was Italian at first, sorry about that, Italy. I wasn't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when? Was it Alan Parsons? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected, terrible. Full of streaks and stuff. The movie was an incoherent mess. Goofy music and clueless characters. The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. I thought the \"doctor\" directing the \"battle\" scene was never going to end. Had some good looking babes though. It seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked. I gave it a 2 for the nekkid women. That bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs. Poe probably did about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his.\n",

Elizabeth Shue Actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in Hollywood. I literally vomited while watching this film. Of course I had the flu, but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode. <br /><br />Why can't Nick Cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor. Nick Cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor. Heck nobody could do it better.<br /><br />The search begins for Nick's contract with Lucifer or was it Lou Cipher from \"Night Train To Terror\".\n",

Roy's character comes off as a bit clueless in this one, along with his female co-star Jane Frazee, who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston, portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan. The whole story seems kind of muddled, with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so. Like the legend of the 'Hangman's Hotel' for example, which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight. With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher, you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up. Instead, you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick. It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve, who truth be told, wound up getting more screen time than Trigger, who's contract as 'Smartest Horse in the Movies' didn't have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule. And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude. I don't know about you, but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh well! <br /><br />Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough, and that turned out to be Roy's athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys. OK, it was probably a stunt double, but I haven't seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns.<br /><br />Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture, as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 1947/1948 time frame. In \"Under California Stars\", she appeared as Andy Devine's cousin, appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher. You're never quite convinced what side she'll come in on in this story though, since she starts out pretending to be someone she's not, and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident.<br /><br />Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown. I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role, but he played it pretty straight after all. I had to wonder, when it was all over, why he and old Vanderpool (Charle Coleman) wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be. Just a way to close it out I guess, with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture. I hate to be that harsh, but if you've seen enough Roy Rogers flicks, you've got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts.<br /><br />Say, Sintown - I wonder if that's the same place that grew up to be Sin City?   \n",

That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />Other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty's Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances passé, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.   \n",

It was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month.<br /><br />I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I saw it at my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. The suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is excellent.<br /><br />   \n",
      "44530  The image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it's more true than false). This begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed Kenneth Branagh to create a full-length, uncut version of \"Hamlet\" with his complete creative control among other things. Of course, Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see? Could they have, at least in this case, had enough respect for the material and Branagh's vision to create something for only a few people? That is not a question that I can answer. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching \"Hamlet.\" Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. However, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before. According to some, Shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion. That being said, I have no doubt that had he been able to see it, the Bard would have been overjoyed with Branagh's production.<br /><br />The film is top-heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts. All play their parts equally well. I would have thought Branagh too old to play the part of Hamlet, and while he still may be, his performance more than makes up for it. Hamlet is a complex part, displaying every emotion from grief to anger, happiness to madness, and everything in between. Branagh nailed it. Derek Jacobi is terrific as the wily Claudius, whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion; his unique voice is perfect for the role. Julie Christie is also very good as Gertrude, Hamlet's caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game.<br /><br />The classical actors are cast in bit parts (Judi Dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they're in it. Surprisingly, no one takes this to heart; everyone gives it their all, and it shows. Special mention has to go to Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are excellent. Robin Williams is a little too silly, but he's not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).<br /><br />Yet, this is undeniably Branagh's show. He adapted one of the most famous plays in history, and in so doing, he took on a whale of a project; it's impressive that he got it done, but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement. What I really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy it. As most people know, Shakespeare is difficult to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand this. \"Hamlet\" is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone and everyone. It may be four hours long, but it's definitely worth it.   \n",

I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough!   \n",

The animation was well done and the romance was cute. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent. What a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now themes (what happens when so-called \"civilization\" invades someone elses home, what does it mean to be \"civilized\" etc.). The opening scenery and music were very stirring. The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful.   \n",
      "47439  The Foreigner is a straight-to-video Steven Seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in March, 2003, an intention which was reportedly reversed when Seagal's prior film (Half Past Dead) tanked at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a lavish $20 million budget, including location shoots in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to a two-picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had a solid following.<br /><br />Despite the size of their investment, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie. It is nearly incomprehensible. What am I saying? It IS incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was going on at all, except in the very broadest terms.<br /><br />Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy. Other mysterious guys try to stop him. Other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him. Other really, really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff, all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out. The intended recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Because he is a self-proclaimed \"consummate professional\" who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband, Seagal at first defies the wife, then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas, as well as from her husband.<br /><br />Many people have mysterious, cryptic conversations. Many people blow each other's brains out. Some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result, so the audience sees somebody die, but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill. Allegiances shift often, adding further mystery. Or should I say confusion?<br /><br />I don't know who was on whose side, or what anybody really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition. At the end of the movie, I just sat there thinking, \"That's the end? What the ...?\"<br /><br />I couldn't even figure out the credits. IMDb says that Aussie actress Kate Fischer (from \"Sirens\") was in this film, but I'll be damned if I know where. Either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project. She could have found some activities more beneficial to her career, like having unnecessary surgery, ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines, or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry.<br /><br />Seagal used to be a pretty fair hand-to-hand combatant, but the action scenes didn't manage to redeem this film at all. Seagal is in his 50's now and is a very large man, so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his inchoate Brandoesque girth. He might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars, although that's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth.<br /><br />Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last film was half past dead, this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half.   \n",

Then I heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effects.Wrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should be.Waverly Hills doesn't need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is.

It is very different from Seagal's other films though, which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans. Unlike some of the other films, this does not feel like a 'Seagal vehicle'. You get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before. The concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change. Although there are some unrealistic parts to the film (some more obvious than others), in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch.<br /><br />It boils down to this: If you are looking for a classic Seagal action film, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. Watch it anyway for the fun of it. If you're open to seeing Seagal without the action, it's well worth a look. I personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while.<br /><br />   \n",

When I got them they were a little melted from shipping in the hot sun, so I put them in the fridge. When I pulled them out and ate them cold they were really great. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these cookies were enough to satisfy it. My only complaint is that I expected the fudge in the center of the cookies to be more liquidy because of the packaging which says 'chewy gooey' but they were still delicious and I would purchase them again. I received both this flavor and the Chocofudge. They were both great, but I prefer the chocofudge better.   \n",

The expiration date was June and I got them in March and was kinda nervous, but we are down to out last 2 bags...many of our friends have enjoyed them! They are very crunchy because they are very thin. They are not like a snyders if that's what your looking for.   \n",

       "287297  I purchased 2 packages this coffee and was shocked when it arrived after I read the ingredients. Tongkat Ali is touted for its many health benefits. But this coffee has creamer made with glucose solids and a \"mixture HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS\". How could they put this terrible Trans fat oil in what is supposed to be a healthy product? Do not buy this product if you are looking for health benefits. I also purchased from the same vendor 2 packages of their \"CNI Tongkat Ali with Ginseng Coffee\" and it does not look any healthier with \"Hardened Vegetable FAT (coconut, palm kernel Oil). Why couldn't they let us put our own creamer in? Why did they have to ruin this coffee with terrible HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS?<br /><br />Also, I purchased several packs at one time because of the expensive shipping charges it made sense to get more packages and pay a little extra shipping. However, now I have to pay return shipping and an 18% restocking fee!<br /><br />I will remember this next time I am buying something that is supposed to be healthy yet they do not list the ingredients. They listed the good ingredients but failed to mention the BAD ones!   \n",

Ordering it here was the easiest and fastest way to get it.  Love this product!  Tried several brands, but Folgers has the best combination of ingredients to make it cafe-quality.  Add nonfat half & half and/or nonfat ice cream and your cappuccino will be every bit as good as cafe-purchased--and you'll save a fortune in money and calories.  Shelf-life is good, so buy it by the case and you won't have to worry about running out.  Can't go a day without my mocha-cap fix!  On a hot day I add nonfat chocolate ice cream and I'm in Heaven!   \n",

The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!   \n",

When I pulled them out and ate them cold they were really great. I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these cookies were enough to satisfy it. My only complaint is that I expected the fudge in the center of the cookies to be more liquidy because of the packaging which says 'chewy gooey' but they were still delicious and I would purchase them again. I received both this flavor and the Chocofudge. They were both great, but I prefer the chocofudge better.\n",

The diversity wasn't bad, but I found a lot of the candy to be stale - as if it was the actual candy from that era, sitting in some candy vault for all these years. The candy that was supposed to be chewy was hard, and some selections (Bit O' Honey, Abbazabba, Turkish Taffy, etc...) had obviously been kept in a hot, humid area because they had melted and hardened into odd unappealing shapes. The hard candy (that was supposed to be hard) was mostly fine. Interesting, but I wouldn't order again.\n",

      "Review Text: I have made a lot of sausage, but this was my first time trying Eastman brand hog casings.  I used up almost an entire package of casings preparing for a recent large BBQ, and I was very disappointed with how many holes I found in each length of casing - between 2 and 5 holes per casing.  Any sausage maker knows the frustration of having to chop casings into 1-2' lengths - just as you get a groove going with your stuffing, you have to stop and put on a new casing.  I bought two packages of Eastman casings, so I am hopeful that I happened to have a bad pack... but when every casing in the pack as multiple holes, it leaves me doubtful.  I will happily update my review if I have a better experience with the second pack.<br /><br />Aside from the holes, I was satisfied with the casing.  They were well-packed in salt, plumped up and softened very nicely after soaking and flushing, and had a nice amount of snap after grilling.\n",

In my estimation, these aren't super hot (though my wife says I can take a lot of heat), but if you prefer things to be with a 'mild kick' these might be a bit overwhelming. Then again, it does say spicy right on the bag!<br /><br />The chips are crispy and not at all brittle like a number of chips out there.. kettle chips, just as the brand says.

These were my dietary staple - especially because you could easily add steamed veggies, garlic, shrimp, fish, crab, fried/poached egg, etc...to make it a more substantial meal.<br /><br />What I love about this instant noodle is that it is similar to Ramen in price and preparation but stepped up several levels in taste and complexity. I loved that there were five seasoning packets - a seasoning powder, fried onions, and three liquids which were chili paste, sweet soy sauce, and oil.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is IMPOSSIBLE to find that five-packet version in the states! When I ordered these here (also ordered from several other specialty sites) they only came with four packets :( No fried onions, and the chili paste was instead a chili powder. While they still taste great, they are not the incredibly addicting noodles I was used to as a poor college student in Australia. I still crave that same taste I got from the version sold in Australia. I wish these were the same so badly, but they are not.<br /><br />I have also noticed a few other reviewers saying it does taste differently than what they remember. I still absolutely recommend these though, because they are still delicious and I always have a case available in the house. Would switch in a heartbeat though if I could find the original five-packet version!\n",

      "Review Text: After trying to nurse my son for the first month under very challenging circumstances, I found it necessary to switch to formula. I started with Similac, as that was all I had on hand from offers sent in the mail. I did lots of research and finally settled on Baby's Only Organic Dairy Formula. I have been feeding this formula to my son ever since he was about a month and a half. I give him a little bit of probiotics and vitamin D3 each day--as recommended by my amazing, unique holistic / MD pediatrician, and this has really helped to build his immune system. He also is able to digest his food beautifully! I have read that it is good for babies to get used to lactose, rather than automatically going for the sensitive, lactose free options. I believe that my son might have a tiny bit of difficulty digesting any formula without the aid of probiotics, but with the probiotics, he is able to digest his formula really well.<br /><br />I LOVE this formula! It is the only one on the market that I could find without the unnecessary and deceiving \"DHA/ARA for brain and eye development\" added, which uses Hexane to extract or produce it for use in baby formulas. Baby's only has the natural fatty acids that help the human body to produce it's own DHA/ARA for brain and eye development. The other formula's use this additive in a very deceptive way--basically just as a selling point by making you think it is something your baby won't get unless it's added, which isn't true!<br /><br />Additionally, Baby's Only appears to be a company of integrity, and I love that. They purposefully label this as a toddler formula, simply because they believe mothers should breast feed their babies for the first 12 months, if at all possible. This formula has all of the necessary nutrients for infant development, and it is comparable to any other top one on the market--only it is less expensive, AND organic!<br /><br />My baby boy smells SO good, and his diapers smell like a normal, healthy breast fed baby's diapers. There is no strong or offensive odor as sometimes caused by other formulas.<br /><br />Check out Baby's Only Organics official site by doing a search online for more excellent information on this awesome product! Absolutely recommended for babies of ALL ages! Best wishes to you!\n",

      "Review Text: This is a very healthy food that is high in fiber and omega-3. Also, being ground makes it easier to digest which is more beneficial to your body. It helps with regularity (relieves constipation), lowers bad cholesterol and has many other health benefits as others have stated here. It's safe to use daily on cereal and other foods. I use 1 tablespoon but more is okay. Sometimes I take it right out of the bag on a tablespoon with a large glass of water to swallow it down. Since I've been using this (for about a year) I haven't had constipation problems. The taste, to me at least, is good. Some people might find it a bit bitter but to me it sort of tastes like a pleasant slightly sweetened wheat cereal. The price is slightly cheaper than the supermarket where 1 bag cost about $4. Here you get 4 bags for less than $15. This was shipped quickly and arrived within a week after I ordered it. With 4 bags which are a pound each this should last for at least 4 months since I'm the only one who uses it in my house. Overall, this is a good deal which I recommend to all who are interested in better health.\n",

Many were wondering if they were east coast products.  The price of the product for what was received was quite excessive, and the cost of the cheapest shipping was astronomical (almost as much as the product).  The box is cute, but some of the individual candy packages arrived opened with contents spilled and broken because it wasn't packaged for shipping.  Luckily I opened the box before presenting it as everything was piled together into a big heap.  I was quite surprised that there wasn't any box filler (stryofoam peanuts, bubble wrap or shredded colored paper) or that the items weren't arranged for giving.  I added my own shredded colored paper and arranged the items, but really felt for the price that it should have been professionally presented.<br /><br />Although a neat idea, I will not purchase any more of these decade boxes from this company for the reasons stated above.

We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.\n",

I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.  I'm planning on packing several ziplocs of this yummy powder with my on my trips so I can have it on my bread for breakfast.

My preferred brewing method is to steep for about 5 minutes, then add a touch of honey. The only thing that could make this tea better is a hint of vanilla, although you could add some of your own if you were so inclined. Of all the teas I've tried, this one is my second favorite, eclipsed only by Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai (which does have that natural vanilla flavoring).\n",

      "Review Text: I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!\n",

The baby loved them and I loved the ingredients.  I thought I would try the other products so I ordered the carrots and sweet potatoes.  To my surprise and disappoinment, when they arrived, I saw that they contained ingredients that I was not pleased with.  I wrote Nurturme and asked why they put maltodextrin in their products unnecessarily and they responded, The organic maltodexrin in our products is derived form organic corn.  Maltodextrins are manufactured form starch and are extensively used as an emulsifier in foods.<br />They are included in our foods because they are binding agents that are used when our foods are dried.  Like starch, most maltodextrins are easily digested and used for energy in the body.\" So, while the carrots and sweet potatoes are probably fine, they did not contain ingredients that I wanted to feed my baby.  The biggest issue being that this information was not included in the product description on amazon.\n",

Be careful not to over-cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart, still tasty though. The soup I make calls for sauteed carrots, celery, & onion. Add ham or sausage if you wish. 1 garlic clove, oregano, salt (if you haven't added salty ham), and optional hot pepper flakes. It is very hardy and filling.

This cereal list a long list of ingredients that include whole corn meal, evaporated cane juice and  molasses. The box only seems to highlight two main points; that the cereal is Gluten-Free and organic. But there is also an appropriate warning that it is produced in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts and soy. I only added milk to the contents of the box and enjoyed the vanilla flavor and did not notice an aftertaste. I liked that it stays crunchy while in milk.

      "Review Text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "Review Text: This coconut water is very good, but also very sweet. It is surprising how sweet this actually is.<br /><br />I've given up drinking soda and most carbonated beverages for a couple of years now. I try to avoid high fructose corn syrup and large amounts of sugers and all artificial sweeteners like the plague. So, needless to say, I was excited to find this product on Amazon at a decent price.<br /><br />I tried my first can the day the package arrived. I only had it in the refridgerator for about an hour, thinking that was sufficient time to chill it down since it had been cold when it was delivered. I'm not sure how much the taste differs between chilled and warm temperatures of the beverage.<br /><br />I think the coconut water is actually too sweet for my own personal preference. But remember, taste is subjective so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The flavor is great, but the sweetness is just a little overpowering for my liking.<br /><br />Also the \"pulp\" is little pieces of coconut meat. It's really mushy, and an odd texture to have in your mouth while you're trying to drink the beverage. Some of the pieces are big enough that they may cause you to slightly choke of you had several that came out in one single gulp. Though I do think they help add to the overall coconut flavor.<br /><br />I may decide to try this product without the pulp.<br /><br />Note that this is a product of Thailand, and has only natural coconut water and pulp ingredients.\n",

      "Review Text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her \"wet food\" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.\n",

      "Review Text: ****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: \"Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing. Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.\"<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****\n",

The diversity wasn't bad, but I found a lot of the candy to be stale - as if it was the actual candy from that era, sitting in some candy vault for all these years. The candy that was supposed to be chewy was hard, and some selections (Bit O' Honey, Abbazabba, Turkish Taffy, etc...) had obviously been kept in a hot, humid area because they had melted and hardened into odd unappealing shapes. The hard candy (that was supposed to be hard) was mostly fine. Interesting, but I wouldn't order again.\n",

      "Review Text: I tried these at random, purchased from a gas station when I wanted a spicy snack. I thought 'really, what do I have to lose?' It took only a few bites before I went looking for how to acquire more. I'd had dill chips before, but this was a new twist that I really went for. In my estimation, these aren't super hot (though my wife says I can take a lot of heat), but if you prefer things to be with a 'mild kick' these might be a bit overwhelming. Then again, it does say spicy right on the bag!<br /><br />The chips are crispy and not at all brittle like a number of chips out there.. kettle chips, just as the brand says. The flavor is packed in, but it doesn't feel like the chip is utterly dowsed with the powder. I pounced the moment I saw these were available, and will be keeping my eye out for more!\n",

I rarely write reviews but had to warn everyone that if you remotely think this is going to taste like ice cream you will be highly disappointed.  It taste like iced, colored gum.  ZERO taste is more like it. And what's up with the picture which I think is kind of deceptive?  First of all there are no 'cookies' and the product is a mousey brown color which is totally unappealing.  Then once you get past that and dig in not even by the biggest stretch of your imagination would you mistake this tasteless gook as some kind of dessert.

The coffee has a strange aroma and after taste (like some sort of a strong chemical), and I have been drinking Italian espressos all my life.  After I ran out of the 4 bricks, I also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning.  No more rushing to the toilet after breakfast!  I initially believed I was beginning to have unknown health problems, but after quitting this coffee, I realized that my health was fine.  For some reason it worked out terribly for me.  Espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me.  Aroma, color, taste, and the feel-good-effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness.\n",

I used up almost an entire package of casings preparing for a recent large BBQ, and I was very disappointed with how many holes I found in each length of casing - between 2 and 5 holes per casing.  Any sausage maker knows the frustration of having to chop casings into 1-2' lengths - just as you get a groove going with your stuffing, you have to stop and put on a new casing.  I bought two packages of Eastman casings, so I am hopeful that I happened to have a bad pack... but when every casing in the pack as multiple holes, it leaves me doubtful.  I will happily update my review if I have a better experience with the second pack.<br /><br />Aside from the holes, I was satisfied with the casing.  They were well-packed in salt, plumped up and softened very nicely after soaking and flushing, and had a nice amount of snap after grilling.\n",

      "Review Text: I fell in love with these while going to University in Australia. Eating three packs a day was not a rare event for me to say the least! These were my dietary staple - especially because you could easily add steamed veggies, garlic, shrimp, fish, crab, fried/poached egg, etc...to make it a more substantial meal.<br /><br />What I love about this instant noodle is that it is similar to Ramen in price and preparation but stepped up several levels in taste and complexity. I loved that there were five seasoning packets - a seasoning powder, fried onions, and three liquids which were chili paste, sweet soy sauce, and oil.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is IMPOSSIBLE to find that five-packet version in the states! When I ordered these here (also ordered from several other specialty sites) they only came with four packets :( No fried onions, and the chili paste was instead a chili powder. While they still taste great, they are not the incredibly addicting noodles I was used to as a poor college student in Australia. I still crave that same taste I got from the version sold in Australia. I wish these were the same so badly, but they are not.<br /><br />I have also noticed a few other reviewers saying it does taste differently than what they remember. I still absolutely recommend these though, because they are still delicious and I always have a case available in the house. Would switch in a heartbeat though if I could find the original five-packet version!\n",

      "Review Text: After trying to nurse my son for the first month under very challenging circumstances, I found it necessary to switch to formula. I started with Similac, as that was all I had on hand from offers sent in the mail. I did lots of research and finally settled on Baby's Only Organic Dairy Formula. I have been feeding this formula to my son ever since he was about a month and a half. I give him a little bit of probiotics and vitamin D3 each day--as recommended by my amazing, unique holistic / MD pediatrician, and this has really helped to build his immune system. He also is able to digest his food beautifully! I have read that it is good for babies to get used to lactose, rather than automatically going for the sensitive, lactose free options. I believe that my son might have a tiny bit of difficulty digesting any formula without the aid of probiotics, but with the probiotics, he is able to digest his formula really well.<br /><br />I LOVE this formula! It is the only one on the market that I could find without the unnecessary and deceiving \"DHA/ARA for brain and eye development\" added, which uses Hexane to extract or produce it for use in baby formulas. Baby's only has the natural fatty acids that help the human body to produce it's own DHA/ARA for brain and eye development. The other formula's use this additive in a very deceptive way--basically just as a selling point by making you think it is something your baby won't get unless it's added, which isn't true!<br /><br />Additionally, Baby's Only appears to be a company of integrity, and I love that. They purposefully label this as a toddler formula, simply because they believe mothers should breast feed their babies for the first 12 months, if at all possible. This formula has all of the necessary nutrients for infant development, and it is comparable to any other top one on the market--only it is less expensive, AND organic!<br /><br />My baby boy smells SO good, and his diapers smell like a normal, healthy breast fed baby's diapers. There is no strong or offensive odor as sometimes caused by other formulas.<br /><br />Check out Baby's Only Organics official site by doing a search online for more excellent information on this awesome product! Absolutely recommended for babies of ALL ages! Best wishes to you!\n",

      "Review Text: This is a very healthy food that is high in fiber and omega-3. Also, being ground makes it easier to digest which is more beneficial to your body. It helps with regularity (relieves constipation), lowers bad cholesterol and has many other health benefits as others have stated here. It's safe to use daily on cereal and other foods. I use 1 tablespoon but more is okay. Sometimes I take it right out of the bag on a tablespoon with a large glass of water to swallow it down. Since I've been using this (for about a year) I haven't had constipation problems. The taste, to me at least, is good. Some people might find it a bit bitter but to me it sort of tastes like a pleasant slightly sweetened wheat cereal. The price is slightly cheaper than the supermarket where 1 bag cost about $4. Here you get 4 bags for less than $15. This was shipped quickly and arrived within a week after I ordered it. With 4 bags which are a pound each this should last for at least 4 months since I'm the only one who uses it in my house. Overall, this is a good deal which I recommend to all who are interested in better health.\n",

Hydrogenated oil, corn syrup... two big no-no's for me. While this was great to try (and this was definitely a treat drink for me), I try to keep the not-so-good for you ingredients out of my diet, which means the remains of this went into the trash.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, this is amazing. If you don't take issue with the ingredients, then by all means, buy it.

      "Review Text: The 60's decade box was well received and everyone enjoyed a trip down memory lane although a good portion of the products were unfamiliar not only to those raised in the 60's, but those older and younger.  Many were wondering if they were east coast products.  The price of the product for what was received was quite excessive, and the cost of the cheapest shipping was astronomical (almost as much as the product).  The box is cute, but some of the individual candy packages arrived opened with contents spilled and broken because it wasn't packaged for shipping.  Luckily I opened the box before presenting it as everything was piled together into a big heap.  I was quite surprised that there wasn't any box filler (stryofoam peanuts, bubble wrap or shredded colored paper) or that the items weren't arranged for giving.  I added my own shredded colored paper and arranged the items, but really felt for the price that it should have been professionally presented.<br /><br />Although a neat idea, I will not purchase any more of these decade boxes from this company for the reasons stated above.  I recently saw a similar item by another company that had just as many candies and was priced less than $15.\n",

      "Review Text: I've long been a fan of the Haribo gummi bears, and in fact won't even eat most other gummy bears. We had friends in Germany that sent us bags of them every year for Christmas and they always bring back fond memories of childhood. While 5 pounds is a LOT of candy, I thought I'd tried these bears from Amazon as they were a good price with the free shipping. Unfortunately I found them to be considerably harder and more difficult to chew than the Haribos you generally get in the smaller gold bags (or the 1 pound bags our friends would send us). Not sure why this is, and the flavor is otherwise okay. But they definitely do not seem to be quite the same quality and I have to wonder if there is a storage issue or some other problem at Amazon that is causing it as I see other reviewers have mentioned it as well. Still, even harder than normal these beat other gummi bears and hopefully with proper storage at home won't get any harder. I doubt I would buy them again from here though but would stick with other sources I've used online and/or locally that provide better quality.\n",

I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa. Obviously, it's more pricey than the peanut butter you would find at Costco or the supermarket but in addition to being light in weight, it's also 85% less fat than regular peanut butter.  I'm planning on packing several ziplocs of this yummy powder with my on my trips so I can have it on my bread for breakfast. The hotels always have jams and jellies but they never offer peanut butter. Now, I'm packing my own and loving it.\n",

The refreshing aroma wafting from my cup is so delightful that it's almost a shame to drink it; I really could just sit there inhaling the vapors. My preferred brewing method is to steep for about 5 minutes, then add a touch of honey. The only thing that could make this tea better is a hint of vanilla, although you could add some of your own if you were so inclined. Of all the teas I've tried, this one is my second favorite, eclipsed only by Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai (which does have that natural vanilla flavoring).\n",

To my surprise and disappoinment, when they arrived, I saw that they contained ingredients that I was not pleased with.

Maltodextrins are manufactured form starch and are extensively used as an emulsifier in foods.<br />They are included in our foods because they are binding agents that are used when our foods are dried.  Like starch, most maltodextrins are easily digested and used for energy in the body.\" So, while the carrots and sweet potatoes are probably fine, they did not contain ingredients that I wanted to feed my baby.

      "Review Text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

It is surprising how sweet this actually is.<br /><br />I've given up drinking soda and most carbonated beverages for a couple of years now. I try to avoid high fructose corn syrup and large amounts of sugers and all artificial sweeteners like the plague. So, needless to say, I was excited to find this product on Amazon at a decent price.<br /><br />I tried my first can the day the package arrived. I only had it in the refridgerator for about an hour, thinking that was sufficient time to chill it down since it had been cold when it was delivered. I'm not sure how much the taste differs between chilled and warm temperatures of the beverage.<br /><br />I think the coconut water is actually too sweet for my own personal preference. But remember, taste is subjective so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The flavor is great, but the sweetness is just a little overpowering for my liking.<br /><br />Also the \"pulp\" is little pieces of coconut meat. It's really mushy, and an odd texture to have in your mouth while you're trying to drink the beverage. Some of the pieces are big enough that they may cause you to slightly choke of you had several that came out in one single gulp. Though I do think they help add to the overall coconut flavor.<br /><br />I may decide to try this product without the pulp.<br /><br />Note that this is a product of Thailand, and has only natural coconut water and pulp ingredients.\n",

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: \"Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing. Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.\"<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****\n",

      "Review Text: Not sure how much to review here.  They're M&M's with peanuts in them.  They taste like every other M&M with peanuts in them, except they've changed the colors to be 'Halloween colored'.  The fact is, they aren't appropriately named.<br /><br />Halloween colored?  Not a chance.<br />Fall colored?  Maybe.<br />Rotting vegetable colored?  Certainly.<br /><br />Whatever it is, they don't look right no matter what they try to call them.  They actually look like sick versions of the other candies, and are ewww-enough looking that NOT A SINGLE M&M WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE CANDY DISH AT THE COMPANY PARTY.  Even after every other candy dish was cleared out and people are scooping at the bits and pieces at the bottom, nobody was taking the 'Halloween-colored' Peanut M&M's at a Halloween party!<br /><br />I know they're M&M's, so I ate them, but when a crowd of people won't touch a candy product at a Halloween party...you know something's not right there.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Get the regular peanut M&M's...they're more Halloween colored.\n",

      "Review Text: I like this and I am switching, although I will continue to buy some Nespresso capsules -- as well as Illy capsules for my Illy machine upstairs.<br /><br />It is hard to predict who will like the ECC coffees and who will not: many things contribute to the experience, and not even just taste, aroma, and looks. I am from Italy, and lived in one of the Italian \"coffee capitals\" -- Trieste, home of Illy, Hausbrandt, San Giusto, and others.<br />[...]<br /><br />I suggest you try this without bias and with neutral expectations. If yr experience is positive, you are lucky and this coffee will save you money, and the Earth some environmental grief.<br /><br />One suggestion to keep you honest in testing the new coffee: don't just compare the Espressivo and yr choice of Nespresso side by side -- DO A BLIND TEST. With two cups that are exactly alike, the same amount of sugar, if any, try both coffees in sequence. Ask an accomplice to keep track of which cup contains which coffee, and see what the test reveals.\n",

      "Review Text: I purchased 2 packages this coffee and was shocked when it arrived after I read the ingredients. Tongkat Ali is touted for its many health benefits. But this coffee has creamer made with glucose solids and a \"mixture HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS\". How could they put this terrible Trans fat oil in what is supposed to be a healthy product? Do not buy this product if you are looking for health benefits. I also purchased from the same vendor 2 packages of their \"CNI Tongkat Ali with Ginseng Coffee\" and it does not look any healthier with \"Hardened Vegetable FAT (coconut, palm kernel Oil). Why couldn't they let us put our own creamer in? Why did they have to ruin this coffee with terrible HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS?<br /><br />Also, I purchased several packs at one time because of the expensive shipping charges it made sense to get more packages and pay a little extra shipping. However, now I have to pay return shipping and an 18% restocking fee!<br /><br />I will remember this next time I am buying something that is supposed to be healthy yet they do not list the ingredients. They listed the good ingredients but failed to mention the BAD ones!\n",

      "Review Text: With so many to choose from, this product is becoming harder to find at the store.  Ordering it here was the easiest and fastest way to get it.  Love this product!  Tried several brands, but Folgers has the best combination of ingredients to make it cafe-quality.  Add nonfat half & half and/or nonfat ice cream and your cappuccino will be every bit as good as cafe-purchased--and you'll save a fortune in money and calories.  Shelf-life is good, so buy it by the case and you won't have to worry about running out.  Can't go a day without my mocha-cap fix!  On a hot day I add nonfat chocolate ice cream and I'm in Heaven!\n",
