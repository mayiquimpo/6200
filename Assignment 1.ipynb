Hmmm, microwavable and ready in a minute and the package screamed out go for it! So I bought 3 thinking I would like them and after all there was 6 grams of protein per serving, too.<br /><br />They are really good and they are homemade too, kinda. Will definitely try all the flavors.\n",

The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade.\n",

      "538997    I try to avoid artificial sweeteners, but I love Mountain Dew and Diet Mountain Dew. I've enjoyed Zevia Root Beer and Cola in the past (though only when poured into a glass - it is nasty straight from the can.)<br /><br />When I saw Mountain Zevia at the Sunflower Market I thought I would give it a try. Uhm, you know how Mountain Dew looks like anti-freeze? This looks more like pee. I can get past that, but it tastes like Airborne - you know the Vitamin/Cold treatment? I would say half orange/half lemon lime Airborne. Not the worst taste, but I don't take Airborne for the flavor, and when I take it I usually mix it with a small amount of water and drink it like a shot.<br /><br />I don't regret trying it, but I won't buy it again. Mountain Dew is incredibly artificial tasting, and I imagine that is hard to duplicate with only natural flavors. Thanks for trying Zevia!<br /><br />I don't recommend this flavor - but I do recommend the Cola and Ginger Root Beer. Those are yum\n",

Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay\n",

Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks.   \n",

These cookies are great for snacks and he really enjoys them. I don't have allergies, and I think these have a bit of a grainy texture, but they aren't bad.

      "401512  The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit rope is a great product.  It can replace those nasty \"fruit flavored\" roll ups and \"fruit snacks\" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright \"fruit flavored\" concoctions, and everything is organic!<br /><br />The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.<br /><br />Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little \"fruit snacks\" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).  Keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice, but if you need something portable, these are a great option.   \n",

That oil had great flavor as well as heat and was ridiculously expensive (about 3 euros for 1oz). This oil unfortunately has very little flavor and is mostly heat. Furthermore it does not taste fresh at all. It has that stale, old, olive oil taste. Possible that it was not stored properly It also has a bit of a chemical taste as well that I think is coming from the rubber seal on the stopper.<br /><br />I will not be using the oil on pizzas or other food because the staleness of the flavor will be too pronounced. I plan on mostly using this to mix with dipping spices and balsamic to dip bread with as that will mask the stale flavor. All in all, It's not awful but I'm pretty disappointed because I had high hopes for it.   \n",

       "      <td>The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit rope is a great product.  It can replace those nasty \"fruit flavored\" roll ups and \"fruit snacks\" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright \"fruit flavored\" concoctions, and everything is organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little \"fruit snacks\" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).  Keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice, but if you need something portable, these are a great option.</td>\n",

This oil unfortunately has very little flavor and is mostly heat. Furthermore it does not taste fresh at all. It has that stale, old, olive oil taste. Possible that it was not stored properly It also has a bit of a chemical taste as well that I think is coming from the rubber seal on the stopper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using the oil on pizzas or other food because the staleness of the flavor will be too pronounced. I plan on mostly using this to mix with dipping spices and balsamic to dip bread with as that will mask the stale flavor.

       "401512  The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit rope is a great product.  It can replace those nasty \"fruit flavored\" roll ups and \"fruit snacks\" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright \"fruit flavored\" concoctions, and everything is organic!<br /><br />The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.<br /><br />Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little \"fruit snacks\" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).  Keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice, but if you need something portable, these are a great option.   \n",

That oil had great flavor as well as heat and was ridiculously expensive (about 3 euros for 1oz). This oil unfortunately has very little flavor and is mostly heat. Furthermore it does not taste fresh at all. It has that stale, old, olive oil taste. Possible that it was not stored properly It also has a bit of a chemical taste as well that I think is coming from the rubber seal on the stopper.<br /><br />I will not be using the oil on pizzas or other food because the staleness of the flavor will be too pronounced. I plan on mostly using this to mix with dipping spices and balsamic to dip bread with as that will mask the stale flavor. All in all, It's not awful but I'm pretty disappointed because I had high hopes for it.   \n",

I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty.   \n",

Found I do not like them. The box had several that had opened and the inside was sticky. I found them to be a messy and pain to open and throw away. I will stick with powder creamer. I also like the flavor of the powder. It is more intense. These have a milder Hazelnut flavor if you prefer milder in your tea or coffee. They are good quality.   \n",

We used this litter for 2 years before moving from NY to KY.  When we got here a few months ago we found out that there were no vendors for this litter within a few 100 miles, so we switched to fresh step crystals .... WE HATE FRESH STEP, I can not wait for my magical litter pearls to get to my doorstep!  I have opted for the subscription, so we will NEVER be without this amazing stuff again!  >^.^&lt;   \n",

      "177903  *****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf.\"<br /><br />Although this tea says \"orange pekoe\", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the \"old stuff\"!<br /><br />*****   \n",

I understand that its not just about bad reviews but good ones too, but for me the product is always great unless I am writing a review.  Thus here I am writing a review today.  I must state that if the coconut oil had not been missing an entire section of coconut oil from the right side of the jar, I would be giving this product 5 stars.  I love the taste, quality, shipping time etc., but the missing oil in the right side of the jar (the oil is solid) shocked the heck out of me.  I would have written something earlier about this, but I just haven't had the time.  Every time I look in the jar though, it still shocks me.  I wondered if it was due to the way the product was packaged.  Maybe it rolled onto its side and caused the top to be more full and the right side to be empty, however, it wasn't full to the top.  Also it's solid and I didn't order it during the warm months for it to be liquid and change.  So, yes, I feel ripped off.  However, I'm using the coconut oil because I do need it and already have it in my possession.  I will not be buying my now bi-monthly supply again through this dealer though, unless they decide to make this right.   \n",
