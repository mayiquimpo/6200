Hmmm, microwavable and ready in a minute and the package screamed out go for it! So I bought 3 thinking I would like them and after all there was 6 grams of protein per serving, too.<br /><br />They are really good and they are homemade too, kinda. Will definitely try all the flavors.\n",

The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade.\n",

      "538997    I try to avoid artificial sweeteners, but I love Mountain Dew and Diet Mountain Dew. I've enjoyed Zevia Root Beer and Cola in the past (though only when poured into a glass - it is nasty straight from the can.)<br /><br />When I saw Mountain Zevia at the Sunflower Market I thought I would give it a try. Uhm, you know how Mountain Dew looks like anti-freeze? This looks more like pee. I can get past that, but it tastes like Airborne - you know the Vitamin/Cold treatment? I would say half orange/half lemon lime Airborne. Not the worst taste, but I don't take Airborne for the flavor, and when I take it I usually mix it with a small amount of water and drink it like a shot.<br /><br />I don't regret trying it, but I won't buy it again. Mountain Dew is incredibly artificial tasting, and I imagine that is hard to duplicate with only natural flavors. Thanks for trying Zevia!<br /><br />I don't recommend this flavor - but I do recommend the Cola and Ginger Root Beer. Those are yum\n",

This green tea is not much of a change.<br /><br />The flavor is there, but it tastes along the lines of your Bigelow and other cheaper greens.  I would definitely pick Gloria Jeans over this on my personal scale, but it's a nice change in pace if you constantly drink greens and want to add some variety.\n",

Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay\n",

It settles the digestive track, aids sleep, and is a mild anti-inflammatory. This is a very good chamomile tea - gentle and yet tasty. Want a good night's sleep?

      "157689  I wish I would have heeded another reviewer's comments about this product not tasting good. She was right. Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little \"graham\" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not \"light and crispy\" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their \"customer promise of satisfaction\", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case.   \n",

We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy.   \n",

They are a little sticky but not enough to get things messy.  I like that they are not like the other fruit snacks that are thin and hardly anything there, these are thick enough that you feel like it is a snack not just a taste.  I will be buying more.   \n",

It settles the digestive track, aids sleep, and is a mild anti-inflammatory. This is a very good chamomile tea - gentle and yet tasty. Want a good night's sleep?

It is very high quality recognizable food, you can see and smell it's tuna, and it's flaked which they love! Amazon offers it at a great price, I will continue to give them the very best and this is it. I Highly recommend Blue buffalo to any of your pets,   \n",
      "113103  I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it   \n",

We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy.   \n",

       "113103  I purchased this to use on my hair and it has done wonders for my hair. I purchased other brands after I purchased this brand and by far it's the best. I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it   \n",

Having used detox in the past, there were certain things I expected, even in a mild form, that never showed, so I am honestly unsure of any detoxing qualities of the tea.  Also, it has a strong cinnamon flavor to me that was very unexpected and as I don't like cinnamon in a drink, unpleasent to me.  But, if your looking for a mild detox stimulant and dont mind cinnamon, I'd say give this tea a try.   \n",

My husband and I bought them from the grocery store and they were 2.98 for a box. So the price of a 3 pack is a horrible price, I would tell everyone to buy from a store instead. The chocolate does melt kind of fast, and it can be messy with crumbs but well worth it to me.   \n",

I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it\n",

      "Review Text: I didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers--unfortunately I got SEVERE abdominal cramps the few times I tried it. Still, it's worth a try because it works for many people. Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping, you are probably sensitive to SENNA, the active ingredient in the tea. So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled \"Stimulant Laxative.\")<br /><br />So what works for me?  Lots of the high-fiber foods every day.  Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.<br /><br />In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways.<br /><br />Nature is great.\n",

In want of a plant-based protein, I bought this product because if it's price and purity.<br /><br />To minimize any icky flavor, I used strongly flavored fruits like banana, blueberry, and strawberry with an orange juice base, added a tbs of flax seed oil, a tbs almond butter, and 4 tbs of this hemp seed powder. I can just barely taste it, the flavor comes through as nutty with the almond butter as other reviewers said, and it is slightly gritty, but it's tolerable. Nowhere close to milled flax seed.

      "Review Text: I am very leery of \"energy drinks.\" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--\"Does that stuff really work?\" Me--\"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!\" Them (two weeks later)--\"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!\"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)\n",

For years he had really nasty (I mean at times explosive) diarrhea and I tried everything from prescription foods, making my own, raw food, medication.  Nothing worked.  This helped almost from the first bite.  Only the rabbit formula worked, none of the poultry.<br /><br />The problem -- very inconsistent.  One bag might be great and the next one he won't eat and/or it causes problems.  I finally bought based on expiration date and when I found one that worked I stocked up.  There is another review posted here that talks about a formula change, but I didn't notice a connection.  The food does look different one expiration date to the next (darker or lighter, the size of the kibble changes).<br /><br />I met a dealer at an expo and he seemed far from interested in hearing about the problem.  If your cat is really sensitive it is definitely worth trying out.  Be prepared for occasional problems and wasted $$.  But it can work miracles.\n",

I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy.

Those reviews usually also complain that their coffee is too weak.<br /><br />The coffee is weak because \"teabagging\" with these pods just doesn't work, in my experience. You need to use a pod coffee brewer, like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G\">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA\">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>, or, if you feel like spending a lot of money, maybe the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00580QKVK\">SunCafe Coffee Pod Brewer</a>. Personally, since I don't own one of these brewers and I didn't know that \"teabagging\" doesn't work until I tried it, I ended up tearing open the pods and emptying them into my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z48XZ0\">Frieling Coffee-for-One Filter</a>. (Putting an unopened pod into the coffee-for-one filter didn't work either.)

Now that I have a daughter who is ill, we have purchased empty capsules for me to fill w her meds. I just squirt the acv into a couple of empty capsules and swallow them quick because the enzymes in it starts to break down the capsule quick. Then i have my warm honey and water drink. I also give my daughter acv 15 min before eating because it really does stimulate your stomach to start digesting foods better, and relieves heartburn. My daughter needed both of these and acv work well for it. It also got rid of a wart on her finger. I also use it on my kids hair when there is a lice scare at school. I spray their hair after shampooing, let it sit for a min, then rinse well. When i blow dry my daughters hair afterward it is shiny! Supposedly it makes the hair less appealing to lice, so they wont want to hop on their head as much. So far no lice and shiny hair.<br />I initially started taking it to balance out my system. I must warn  people not to overdo it, you can give your self a UTI...it will wash away a lot of your good bacteria as well as bad so, a little dab will do ya. More is not always better. I do get energy boosts from it, which is nice. I get it at my grocery store for cheaper than here, too.<br />ALSO, if you make homemade soups with chicken or beef bones, throw a tbl in right when you start. It leeches out all the good minerals from the bones like calcium that your body needs. Leaves no flavor, promise.\n",

I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.\n",

      "Review Text: I love lattes and pumpkin spice sounded like the perfect flavor to try at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I used a measuring spoon to ensure that I put in the correct amount, but the flavor was very watery.  Think iced tea diluted two to three times beyond the recommended amount.  The flavor was more what I would expect from a cheap \"pumpkin spice\" herbal tea rather than the usual \"International Coffee\" latte.<br /><br />I added 50% more powder, but the flavor got sweeter but not richer.  Overall, this was very disappointing, and my guests agreed.  None of us finished our mugs.\n",

      "Review Text: There's nothing really wrong with this rice, but there's nothing really special about it either.  It's serviceable.  I cook it in my rice cooker and the basmati aroma is indeed very pleasant.  I did think, based on basmati brown rice I bought from a Safeway store, that the fiber content would be higher.  It's actually 1g (4% of the RDA) per 1/4 cup.  That's not high, although it's a step up from plain ol' white rice.  Other nutritional details: 180 calories, 38g carbs, 3g protein, plus calcium 2%, iron 6%, thiamine 13% and Niacin 8%. Although not listed on the product label, B vitamins are also found in Basmati brown rice.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, the rice is not theoretically loose inside the burlap bag (which is double-sewn shut and has a zipper) because there's a inner plastic bag.  The plastic bag is cheap and flimsy though, and somewhere along the way a lot of the rice left the bag I got (assuming it started in it) and was just loose inside the burlap. I emptied it all into ziplock bags to store in the freezer.<br /><br />The expiration date is Jan 2014. I paid just under $15 and expect to be eating this rice for many months to come. Make that many, MANY months to come.\n",

      "Review Text: I wish I would have heeded another reviewer's comments about this product not tasting good. She was right. Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little \"graham\" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not \"light and crispy\" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their \"customer promise of satisfaction\", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case.\n",

      "Review Text: I have tried every type of premium dog food on the market. Literally, but my dogs didn't like any of them. I've  been to the holistic vet for suggestions for food, we tried mixing dry/wet we tried homemade dog food, we have tried everything - all with limited success. The only food we can consistently give them that they are excited to eat, from their bowls is fresh vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, carrots, etc that the holistic vet suggested we supplement their diet. My dogs have been successfully eating Sojos for the longest period and the health benefits are AMAZING!<br /><br />I have a schnauzer poodle mix who is now almost two years old. In her short life we've visited the vet over 20 times because she has eye problems. She had entropion eyelid surgery because her eyelids rolled in and her eyelashes would scratch her eye (can you imagine living with the feeling that you constantly had hair/eyelashes stuck in your eye?) Then, when visiting the doggy eye-doctor we discovered our sweet girl was not producing ANY tears in one eye and close to none in the other eye. We had to put her on strong eye drops for the rest of her life that would help to make her tear glands produce tears. In addition we were putting in an eye gel to simulate tears in her eyes and moisten her eye ball. I hated giving her the eye drops because of the side effects: when she would smell human food (never dog food) she would salivate and it would drip from her mouth. So I stopped giving the eye drops and started using the eye gel more.<br /><br />I never considered that her diet and her dry-eye would be related but after I stopped the eye drops we tried Sojos because the girls literally wouldn't eat their very expensive food we had been purchasing. Amazingly, they ate it every time. Over the next four weeks we noticed that we had to put less and less eye gel into her eyes because her eye did not need them. Her eyes looked healthy and were moist. We took her back to the doggy eye doctor and their test confirmed what we had seen - her eye had started to produce tears by themselves.<br /><br />I should not be surprised as I suffer from severe allergies know the effects that allergies can have on my body. In taking away the grain and feeding my dogs Sojos, my sweet dog's allergies have subsided and her eye has improved. I am so grateful she is feeling better and enjoying the food she is eating. I do believe it was a grain that she was allergic to, I don't think the meat in Sojos made the difference. It is very possible that another grain-free food would have produced the same benefits. I am not going to test this theory as I have been waiting for years to find a successful food for my dogs. I do shout the benefits of going grain-free. If you are trying a different food or trying to decide to make the change, I think it is worth the money to see if it will benefit your dog. I wasn't expecting it would make the difference that it did and I ECSTATIC about it! I highly recommend going grain-free and think that Sojos is a great option.\n",

It's made with a mixture of erithyritol and stevia, and admittedly, I have been eating these sugar substitutes for awhile so I'm quite used to the taste, but honestly, even my husband loves this stuff.  We also have friends who have recently started to buy it for themselves because it's a healthier alternative to regular soda.  Now, yes, I know--any carbonated beverage should be consumed in moderation as it can prevent your body from absorbing calcium (or so I've read) so don't go crazy or anything! I will say though that having a soda with a gluten-free slice of pizza feels just like the good ol' days when all I ate was crap! :)  I also appreciate the caffeine free version of this soda as caffeine makes me a little goofy.

      "Review Text: This stuff is amazing, 10 times better then generic \"curry powder\" that you'll find in bulk, or most of the stuff you'll find in jars at stores.  I've had some home made, and some restaurant Indian cooking that equals or betters the flavor of this curry powder, but, to achieve that they have roasted fresh whole seeds in oil and used other traditional Indian cooking methods which are a little more difficult than simply sprinkling a pile of this wonderful powder over a pan full of onions in a pan.<br /><br />If you don't want to use butter in your curry recipe you can use canola oil instead and it won't be quite as good, but still delicious.  I usually make a curry with a couple chopped onions, cauliflower, chicken, a handful of black currents, and canned or frozen peas, everyone LOVES it.  If you want to add a sauce you can saute finely chopped onions and tomatoes with curry powder and puree it.  You could also optionally add any of the following to the sauce: tomato paste, cardamom, tamarind, lentils (dahl), cream, chopped apples or pears, mango, coconut, coconut milk (more of an east Asian style if you add coconut/coconut milk).<br /><br />If you add cream to your curry, that usually goes best when it has a tomato flavored sauce, at an Indian restaurant you'll find this in a dish called \"Chicken Tikka Masala\" which is a decadent and delicious dish.<br /><br />PLEASE AMAZON, bring this item back in stock as soon as possilbe!!! PLEASE!<br /><br />I was so excited when I found it, but I couldn't order it right then as I was headed out.  When I tried to order it the next day I was devastated to find it was sold out :(  This is such a better deal than the offers from other sellers on here for just one can.<br /><br />If I could give this product an extra sixth star, I would.\n",

Still, it's worth a try because it works for many people. Just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping, you are probably sensitive to SENNA, the active ingredient in the tea. So stay away from other SENNA products, too. (usually labeled \"Stimulant Laxative.\")<br /><br />So what works for me?  Lots of the high-fiber foods every day.  Plenty of raw fruits (except banana) and vegetables (two raw carrots a day works wonders!)  Whole grains every day makes a big difference--I especially like brown rice and oatmeal. Apples are yummy: I eat one every day.  Eating beans and legumes is also very helpful.  Buy some dried lentils--they cook the fastest--and google some soup recipes. And keep products made with white flour to a minimum.<br /><br />In the worst case scenario, try plain old water. Both ways.<br /><br />Nature is great.\n",

One day, it's a little dab - you know, for kicks.  To look cool.  Fit in with the hipsters.  A month later, heck - for me it was half a day - I'm a certified Ratch Head, holding a bottle of the Red Devil upside down like a plasma bag, sucking the heat from a clear plastic tube that I ripped from my little girl's aquarium air pump.  The fish died, but I didn't care.  They tasted sooo goooooood.<br /><br />I lost everything.  My faith in ketchup.  My faith in Chinese mustard.  My cutlery (no pride, I'd just face-plant onto the plate and suck.)  When the intervention happened, they found me curled up in the Specialty Foods Aisle of Target with a fiery cake of Ratch and oyster crackers pasted to my face and clothes.<br /><br />Rehab taught me that once a Ratch Head, always.  I met people there who assured me that I was ok without Sriracha.  That I didn't NEED heat.  The doctors, Mr. Heinz and Mrs. French put me on a new diet of quiet, soft condiments that - well, sure.  They don't have flavor, but they're certainly not making me think of them every hour of the day, either.<br /><br />I have a steady job now, new friends and tonight, we're getting together for Tuna Helper and instant lemonade.<br /><br />Stay away from Srirach sauce.<br /><br />Wait.

      "Review Text: This food has been a lifesaver (literally, according to my vet) for my 10 year old.  For years he had really nasty (I mean at times explosive) diarrhea and I tried everything from prescription foods, making my own, raw food, medication.  Nothing worked.  This helped almost from the first bite.  Only the rabbit formula worked, none of the poultry.<br /><br />The problem -- very inconsistent.  One bag might be great and the next one he won't eat and/or it causes problems.  I finally bought based on expiration date and when I found one that worked I stocked up.  There is another review posted here that talks about a formula change, but I didn't notice a connection.  The food does look different one expiration date to the next (darker or lighter, the size of the kibble changes).<br /><br />I met a dealer at an expo and he seemed far from interested in hearing about the problem.  If your cat is really sensitive it is definitely worth trying out.  Be prepared for occasional problems and wasted $$.  But it can work miracles.\n",

This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation. I've found it helps with both the cramps and mood swings of PMS, and even seems to lessen eye strain headaches. It's also proving invaluable as a way to counteract the rebound insomnia and moodiness of withdrawal from a prescription sleep medication. I take away one star (and would make that a half if I could), because in its raw form (or merely blended with water), it tastes terrible. But mixed with a sweet juice, it's decently palatable.\n",

In want of a plant-based protein, I bought this product because if it's price and purity.<br /><br />To minimize any icky flavor, I used strongly flavored fruits like banana, blueberry, and strawberry with an orange juice base, added a tbs of flax seed oil, a tbs almond butter, and 4 tbs of this hemp seed powder. I can just barely taste it, the flavor comes through as nutty with the almond butter as other reviewers said, and it is slightly gritty, but it's tolerable. Nowhere close to milled flax seed.

      "Review Text: I am very leery of \"energy drinks.\" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--\"Does that stuff really work?\" Me--\"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!\" Them (two weeks later)--\"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!\"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups!

No amount of pumpkin, yogurt, oil, or fiber was changing things, and the vet was happy we came in for not infrequent Ova/parasite checks which were all negative.<br /><br />After trying all of the Wellness brand combos we tried Core Fish and our dog loves the taste, and for once isn't the poop-ing-est dog at the dog park. It's not cheap and absolutely I'm sure there are other options for most dogs, but if you have a Boxer or sensitive stomached dog and are used to being the person with 5 poop bags all the time give it a try if you have the budget.\n",

      "Review Text: When Princess came to me, she was on mostly dry food. She didn't seem to interested in her food, and used to dump it into her water before eating it. Her previous foster mum suggested I get her moist food. Then started the search. I purchased cans and pouches. And she didn't seem to interested in most of them. I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy. She definitely love this brand, and get different taste every day. And a happy cat makes a happy mum :)\n",

      "Review Text: I've seen some reviews for these coffee \"pods\" where people say they used the pod like a teabag, just throwing it into a cup, pouring boiling water over it and letting it steep for a while. Those reviews usually also complain that their coffee is too weak.<br /><br />The coffee is weak because \"teabagging\" with these pods just doesn't work, in my experience. You need to use a pod coffee brewer, like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G\">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA\">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>, or, if you feel like spending a lot of money, maybe the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00580QKVK\">SunCafe Coffee Pod Brewer</a>. Personally, since I don't own one of these brewers and I didn't know that \"teabagging\" doesn't work until I tried it, I ended up tearing open the pods and emptying them into my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z48XZ0\">Frieling Coffee-for-One Filter</a>. (Putting an unopened pod into the coffee-for-one filter didn't work either.) The packaging of this product really ought to include some instructions about how to (and how not to) use it.<br /><br />Once I started brewing it correctly, I really liked the flavor of this coffee. I like yirgacheffe coffees in general, and this is a good one. It's a rich, fairly dark roast, with some nice earthy and berry flavors to it.\n",

      "Review Text: I have been stocking this in my cabinet for years. I used to drink a tsp in a cup of warm filtered water w raw honey. Now that I have a daughter who is ill, we have purchased empty capsules for me to fill w her meds. I just squirt the acv into a couple of empty capsules and swallow them quick because the enzymes in it starts to break down the capsule quick. Then i have my warm honey and water drink. I also give my daughter acv 15 min before eating because it really does stimulate your stomach to start digesting foods better, and relieves heartburn. My daughter needed both of these and acv work well for it. It also got rid of a wart on her finger. I also use it on my kids hair when there is a lice scare at school. I spray their hair after shampooing, let it sit for a min, then rinse well. When i blow dry my daughters hair afterward it is shiny! Supposedly it makes the hair less appealing to lice, so they wont want to hop on their head as much. So far no lice and shiny hair.<br />I initially started taking it to balance out my system. I must warn  people not to overdo it, you can give your self a UTI...it will wash away a lot of your good bacteria as well as bad so, a little dab will do ya. More is not always better. I do get energy boosts from it, which is nice. I get it at my grocery store for cheaper than here, too.<br />ALSO, if you make homemade soups with chicken or beef bones, throw a tbl in right when you start. It leeches out all the good minerals from the bones like calcium that your body needs. Leaves no flavor, promise.\n",

      "Review Text: The texture on these things is all off.  For one, they're incredibly airy.  I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.\n",

      "Review Text: There's nothing really wrong with this rice, but there's nothing really special about it either.  It's serviceable.  I cook it in my rice cooker and the basmati aroma is indeed very pleasant.  I did think, based on basmati brown rice I bought from a Safeway store, that the fiber content would be higher.  It's actually 1g (4% of the RDA) per 1/4 cup.  That's not high, although it's a step up from plain ol' white rice.  Other nutritional details: 180 calories, 38g carbs, 3g protein, plus calcium 2%, iron 6%, thiamine 13% and Niacin 8%. Although not listed on the product label, B vitamins are also found in Basmati brown rice.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, the rice is not theoretically loose inside the burlap bag (which is double-sewn shut and has a zipper) because there's a inner plastic bag.  The plastic bag is cheap and flimsy though, and somewhere along the way a lot of the rice left the bag I got (assuming it started in it) and was just loose inside the burlap. I emptied it all into ziplock bags to store in the freezer.<br /><br />The expiration date is Jan 2014. I paid just under $15 and expect to be eating this rice for many months to come. Make that many, MANY months to come.\n",

      "Review Text: I wish I would have heeded another reviewer's comments about this product not tasting good. She was right. Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little \"graham\" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not \"light and crispy\" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their \"customer promise of satisfaction\", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case.\n",

      "Review Text: I have tried every type of premium dog food on the market. Literally, but my dogs didn't like any of them. I've  been to the holistic vet for suggestions for food, we tried mixing dry/wet we tried homemade dog food, we have tried everything - all with limited success. The only food we can consistently give them that they are excited to eat, from their bowls is fresh vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, carrots, etc that the holistic vet suggested we supplement their diet. My dogs have been successfully eating Sojos for the longest period and the health benefits are AMAZING!<br /><br />I have a schnauzer poodle mix who is now almost two years old. In her short life we've visited the vet over 20 times because she has eye problems. She had entropion eyelid surgery because her eyelids rolled in and her eyelashes would scratch her eye (can you imagine living with the feeling that you constantly had hair/eyelashes stuck in your eye?) Then, when visiting the doggy eye-doctor we discovered our sweet girl was not producing ANY tears in one eye and close to none in the other eye. We had to put her on strong eye drops for the rest of her life that would help to make her tear glands produce tears. In addition we were putting in an eye gel to simulate tears in her eyes and moisten her eye ball. I hated giving her the eye drops because of the side effects: when she would smell human food (never dog food) she would salivate and it would drip from her mouth. So I stopped giving the eye drops and started using the eye gel more.<br /><br />I never considered that her diet and her dry-eye would be related but after I stopped the eye drops we tried Sojos because the girls literally wouldn't eat their very expensive food we had been purchasing. Amazingly, they ate it every time. Over the next four weeks we noticed that we had to put less and less eye gel into her eyes because her eye did not need them. Her eyes looked healthy and were moist. We took her back to the doggy eye doctor and their test confirmed what we had seen - her eye had started to produce tears by themselves.<br /><br />I should not be surprised as I suffer from severe allergies know the effects that allergies can have on my body. In taking away the grain and feeding my dogs Sojos, my sweet dog's allergies have subsided and her eye has improved. I am so grateful she is feeling better and enjoying the food she is eating. I do believe it was a grain that she was allergic to, I don't think the meat in Sojos made the difference. It is very possible that another grain-free food would have produced the same benefits. I am not going to test this theory as I have been waiting for years to find a successful food for my dogs. I do shout the benefits of going grain-free. If you are trying a different food or trying to decide to make the change, I think it is worth the money to see if it will benefit your dog. I wasn't expecting it would make the difference that it did and I ECSTATIC about it! I highly recommend going grain-free and think that Sojos is a great option.\n",

I've had some home made, and some restaurant Indian cooking that equals or betters the flavor of this curry powder, but, to achieve that they have roasted fresh whole seeds in oil and used other traditional Indian cooking methods which are a little more difficult than simply sprinkling a pile of this wonderful powder over a pan full of onions in a pan.<br /><br />If you don't want to use butter in your curry recipe you can use canola oil instead and it won't be quite as good, but still delicious.  I usually make a curry with a couple chopped onions, cauliflower, chicken, a handful of black currents, and canned or frozen peas, everyone LOVES it.  If you want to add a sauce you can saute finely chopped onions and tomatoes with curry powder and puree it.  You could also optionally add any of the following to the sauce: tomato paste, cardamom, tamarind, lentils (dahl), cream, chopped apples or pears, mango, coconut, coconut milk (more of an east Asian style if you add coconut/coconut milk).<br /><br />If you add cream to your curry, that usually goes best when it has a tomato flavored sauce, at an Indian restaurant you'll find this in a dish called \"Chicken Tikka Masala\" which is a decadent and delicious dish.<br /><br />PLEASE AMAZON, bring this item back in stock as soon as possilbe!!!

      "Review Text: First off, my dog responds to this food like nothing in the world...raw beef, liver treats, cheese, all of his favorites pale in comparison.  I use the large chunks straight out of the bag as treats, and daily I give him a small amount of it mixed with warm (not hot) water.  Let it sit for a few minutes and it becomes a gravy-like consistency.  My dog loves this more than anything in the world, and I feel good knowing I'm giving him something so healthy.  Do right by your dog and give him variety through raw foods and Wysong!\n",

      "Review Text: I have been using Pill Pockets for years and am VERY disappointed that Greenies changed the ingredients. Not only are they not as moist, but they removed the probiotic which aids in digestion. They say only the packaging has changed, but I had an old package and compared the ingredients and they are DEFINITELY different. It is still a Good way to give a pill, but not as healthy or tasty. I have even found unknown pieces of hard stuff in some, (I use to break them up and roll into balls and give as treats. I have tried to track down any of the originals, but unfortunately, they seem to be all gone. So, if you need to give your cat a pill, buy them, I just don't give them as treats anymore. Sad that such a great product has gone from a 10 to a 4, in my opinion. And what's sadder, I wrote to Greenies about the ingredients  about 3 months ago and I have yet to hear a thing from them... Not very good customer relations.\n",

      "Review Text: I eat these with crackers (unsalted tops), and crushed red pepper, or Texas Pete hot sauce.  These are a good switch out with other Compleats.  Of course, I do spice them up, but my taste is that these are better (taste better, and have less liquid) than the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce.  Just ordered 2 boxes.  Use subscribe and save.  You can set it up and skip or ship now, as you please, while saving several dollars.\n",

      "Review Text: Really for the price you can't beat the quality ingredients. I got lucky and my cats actually like the taste. Its quite a bit more expensive than what I was feeding them, but also much better for them. Just make sure you transition it slowly, I added a bit too much into the mix one of the days and my cat felt a bit sick for a day, but has been fine since.<br /><br />Edit: I have been feeding this to my cats for over a month now and have noticed they seem much more energetic.<br /><br />Edit 2: This review was written during the old formula. My cats actually prefer the new shape but I don't like the new ingredient list.. they really reduced that salmon. Hopefully they compensated with more chicken but no way of knowing. My cats have seemed a bit less energetic since the switch to their new formula so doubting it is as healthy. I'm guessing the formula was to reduce production cost yet the price has gone up.. so I'm taking off a star.\n",

Having used detox in the past, there were certain things I expected, even in a mild form, that never showed, so I am honestly unsure of any detoxing qualities of the tea.  Also, it has a strong cinnamon flavor to me that was very unexpected and as I don't like cinnamon in a drink, unpleasent to me.  But, if your looking for a mild detox stimulant and dont mind cinnamon, I'd say give this tea a try.\n",
