Hmmm, microwavable and ready in a minute and the package screamed out go for it!

Will definitely try all the flavors.\n",

The sauce is thin and runny and doesn't have much flavor. If you need a boxed dinner in a pinch, then by all means use a product with natural ingredients. But if you want good mac and cheese, stick with homemade.\n",

      "538997    I try to avoid artificial sweeteners, but I love Mountain Dew and Diet Mountain Dew. I've enjoyed Zevia Root Beer and Cola in the past (though only when poured into a glass - it is nasty straight from the can.)<br /><br />When I saw Mountain Zevia at the Sunflower Market I thought I would give it a try. Uhm, you know how Mountain Dew looks like anti-freeze? This looks more like pee. I can get past that, but it tastes like Airborne - you know the Vitamin/Cold treatment? I would say half orange/half lemon lime Airborne. Not the worst taste, but I don't take Airborne for the flavor, and when I take it I usually mix it with a small amount of water and drink it like a shot.<br /><br />I don't regret trying it, but I won't buy it again. Mountain Dew is incredibly artificial tasting, and I imagine that is hard to duplicate with only natural flavors. Thanks for trying Zevia!<br /><br />I don't recommend this flavor - but I do recommend the Cola and Ginger Root Beer. Those are yum\n",

Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay\n",

      "269709        We tried a variety of pods in our Francis Francis X5 and these were by far the best.  Been ordering this stuff for years now.  The taste is very smooth and not bitter.  This stuff spoils us because the espresso at the coffeeshops around here are never as good.<br /><br />Of course, crema-wise you'll still do better with whole beans and a high quality grinder.  We get a thin crema top with these but that's about it.  As I think everyone understands there's a tradeoff to be made with pods--and no other pod I've tried has ever been any better for me in this respect--I haven't held that against this product.<br /><br />Highly recommended.   \n",

Infact it's our favorite Zatarain's meal, and has oddly become hard to find. We didn't find this to be too salty, but neither are we on a low sodium diet. It's easy to experiment with by adding more spices, veggies, different meats, and even usable with TVP (not my thing). Try it and enjoy.   \n",
      "462167  I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.   \n",

       "269709        We tried a variety of pods in our Francis Francis X5 and these were by far the best.  Been ordering this stuff for years now.  The taste is very smooth and not bitter.  This stuff spoils us because the espresso at the coffeeshops around here are never as good.<br /><br />Of course, crema-wise you'll still do better with whole beans and a high quality grinder.  We get a thin crema top with these but that's about it.  As I think everyone understands there's a tradeoff to be made with pods--and no other pod I've tried has ever been any better for me in this respect--I haven't held that against this product.<br /><br />Highly recommended.   \n",

Infact it's our favorite Zatarain's meal, and has oddly become hard to find. We didn't find this to be too salty, but neither are we on a low sodium diet. It's easy to experiment with by adding more spices, veggies, different meats, and even usable with TVP (not my thing). Try it and enjoy.   \n",
       "462167  I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.   \n",

      "54884   I purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid-March-2008. I used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener. Tonight I've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener. So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end!  This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.<br /><br />The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.<br /><br />With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders. I will be contacting the manufacturer ASAP to see if there has been a recall or known problem.   \n",

I order these flowers early thinking it would take at least a week to get them. They came two days later!! I thought oh no there not going to look good on Mothers Day,to my surprised they lasted 21/2 weeks!! I guess straight from the farm really works. I highly recommend this product. Oh and they came with a beautiful crystal vase!! NOT BAD!!!   \n",

We get a thin crema top with these but that's about it.  As I think everyone understands there's a tradeoff to be made with pods--and no other pod I've tried has ever been any better for me in this respect--I haven't held that against this product.<br /><br />Highly recommended.   \n",

This stuff spoils us because the espresso at the coffeeshops around here are never as good.<br /><br />Of course, crema-wise you'll still do better with whole beans and a high quality grinder.  We get a thin crema top with these but that's about it.  As I think everyone understands there's a tradeoff to be made with pods--and no other pod I've tried has ever been any better for me in this respect--I haven't held that against this product.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\n",

I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.\n",

He was amazed they were dog treats (& may have still tried one, had I not been around). Vet approved & made in the USA, you can happily give them to your dog knowing they are safe, unlike all the 'Made In China' treats always on recall for making dogs sick. Sized like a real cookie, they give a bigger dog something to chew a while, while also soft enough for a smaller dog to break apart. They also come in 2 separate sealed bags, so they stay fresh.

      "Review Text: First impression: meh. I sampled a few more, and the flavor kind of grew on me. You can taste all the ingredients you're supposed to notice--oats, cranberries, a little hint of citrus. Then I tried it with my coffee, and it was GOOD.<br /><br />I think that's the key--other reviewers have noted that tea or coffee goes great with this snack. It's not something you can mindlessly shove into your mouth while watching reality shows, not that I ever do that, but if you need a little treat in the afternoon, it's tasty with a cup of joe.<br /><br />The cranberries made this chewy, which was a nice combination (like pinwheel cookies). Putting two textures together can be tricky, and if not done correctly, is a real turn-off for me. But here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other.<br /><br />My family tasted these, as well. One of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three (140 calories). Not a big deal, but if you're going for the health-conscious crowd, that may be a little too steep. Other household members said these cookies were average, but then they lean toward big gooey chocolate desserts.<br /><br />So try these--but don't forget to fire up Mr. Coffee first.\n",

They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.

This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.<br /><br />The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.<br /><br />With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders.

A proper feline diet should be void of dry cat food and most important is a quality ingredient wet cat food(if you cannot feed a raw diet) and I believe there is no better product than this!! Cats seem to absolutely love it, and it smells and looks just like freshly cooked chicken - which it is!! It is great for their urinary tract, and there are many interesting choices of Weruva to satisfy your cat's culinary diversity.  I cannot say enough about this product. My 3 month old kitten was not gaining weight, and  my veterinarian and I were very concerned. He had simply lost his appetite and was not gaining an ounce over 3lbs although I purchased so many different premium foods to entice him! When I was told about Weruva and first gave it a try, my kitten regained his zest for eating and immediately gained weight and is the most beautiful cat you would ever see!! He is 6 months old now and close to ten pounds!! He comes running the minute I open the Weruva stocked cabinet. It was a godsend & you can see the quality in every single can that you open!!\n",

      "Review Text: We have a 6 month old Shih Tzu and a 2 year old white fluffy mix.  They weight 8lbs and 15 lbs respectively.  Each eats about 1 scoop a day.  Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.<br /><br />So we are huge fans!\n",

      "Review Text: We've owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it's worth more.<br /><br />Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don't assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn't a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you've optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you'll have great results each and every time.<br /><br />Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time.<br /><br />Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first \"coffee machine\" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck's with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you'll get from most cafes. However, it's not as good as you'll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it's quite consistent. Don't forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance.<br /><br />Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can't do true microfoam.<br /><br />Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we've otherwise not had problems. Also, it's the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines.<br /><br />Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price.<br /><br />Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important.<br /><br />Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want.\n",

The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.\n",

      "Review Text: First impression: meh. I sampled a few more, and the flavor kind of grew on me. You can taste all the ingredients you're supposed to notice--oats, cranberries, a little hint of citrus. Then I tried it with my coffee, and it was GOOD.<br /><br />I think that's the key--other reviewers have noted that tea or coffee goes great with this snack. It's not something you can mindlessly shove into your mouth while watching reality shows, not that I ever do that, but if you need a little treat in the afternoon, it's tasty with a cup of joe.<br /><br />The cranberries made this chewy, which was a nice combination (like pinwheel cookies). Putting two textures together can be tricky, and if not done correctly, is a real turn-off for me. But here the crunchy/chewy textures enhance each other.<br /><br />My family tasted these, as well. One of my kids liked the cookie but thought the calorie count a little high for a serving of three (140 calories). Not a big deal, but if you're going for the health-conscious crowd, that may be a little too steep. Other household members said these cookies were average, but then they lean toward big gooey chocolate desserts.<br /><br />So try these--but don't forget to fire up Mr. Coffee first.\n",

      "Review Text: Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable.\n",

      "Review Text: A 5 star must have canned act food for the discerning cat lover!! A proper feline diet should be void of dry cat food and most important is a quality ingredient wet cat food(if you cannot feed a raw diet) and I believe there is no better product than this!! Cats seem to absolutely love it, and it smells and looks just like freshly cooked chicken - which it is!! It is great for their urinary tract, and there are many interesting choices of Weruva to satisfy your cat's culinary diversity.  I cannot say enough about this product. My 3 month old kitten was not gaining weight, and  my veterinarian and I were very concerned. He had simply lost his appetite and was not gaining an ounce over 3lbs although I purchased so many different premium foods to entice him! When I was told about Weruva and first gave it a try, my kitten regained his zest for eating and immediately gained weight and is the most beautiful cat you would ever see!! He is 6 months old now and close to ten pounds!! He comes running the minute I open the Weruva stocked cabinet. It was a godsend & you can see the quality in every single can that you open!!\n",

      "Review Text: We have a 6 month old Shih Tzu and a 2 year old white fluffy mix.  They weight 8lbs and 15 lbs respectively.  Each eats about 1 scoop a day.  Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.<br /><br />So we are huge fans!\n",

      "Review Text: We've owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it's worth more.<br /><br />Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don't assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn't a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you've optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you'll have great results each and every time.<br /><br />Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time.<br /><br />Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first \"coffee machine\" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck's with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you'll get from most cafes. However, it's not as good as you'll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it's quite consistent. Don't forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance.<br /><br />Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can't do true microfoam.<br /><br />Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we've otherwise not had problems. Also, it's the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines.<br /><br />Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price.<br /><br />Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important.<br /><br />Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want.\n",

Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!\n",
